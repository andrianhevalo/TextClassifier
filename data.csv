The text about food intake should come at the end of the day. I usually get it midday when I haven't had all meals yet so hard to judge the intake. Also the daily question about stress I think needs a middle ground. It goes from handled it well to derailed. I would think a middle option or "" very stressed but still able to function""would be good.  Lastly for even more accountability maybe a question about how they are measuring against their goal. So if weight loss is a goal, ask their goal weight or desired weight to lose and ask daily question about current weight. ",FOOD,4
